        "solution": "We designed an 800m² flagship in Casablanca that breaks with traditional car dealership codes. The space combines immersive exhibition areas, interactive technologies, and a smooth customer journey that naturally guides visitors from discovery to test drives, then to personalized configuration. Each zone was designed to highlight the distinctive attributes of each model, with noble materials that reinforce the brand's premium positioning.",
        "results": "The new flagship generated a 40% increase in time spent in the dealership and a conversion rate 28% higher than traditional dealerships. The customer experience received an average rating of 4.8/5, and sales of premium models increased by 35% over the first six months. This concept has become a benchmark in the Moroccan automotive sector and is being deployed in other key cities."

        "solution": "We developed Morocco's first professional e-sports league. Structured around 3 major games (League of Legends, FIFA, and Fortnite), the competition combined online qualifiers and spectacular physical finals. Beyond the competition itself, we created a complete ecosystem with training programs, educational content on gaming careers, and partnerships with international teams for masterclasses.",
        "results": "The first season brought together more than 7,800 participants and generated 2.4 million views on live broadcasts. Impact studies showed a 37% improvement in brand preference indicators among 15-25 year-olds, and a significant increase in data plan subscriptions. The program also enabled the emergence of Morocco's first professional teams and positioned inwi as a legitimate and committed player in the local gaming ecosystem."

The challenge was to educate and train local populations on the concrete benefits of digital tools.",
        "solution": "We designed and deployed a national roadshow covering 18 cities in 45 days. The traveling setup included a 200m² high-tech mobile showroom with practical service experimentation areas, training spaces, and personalized consultations. Each stop was adapted to local specificities (language, economic needs) and facilitated by teams from the communities visited.",
        "results": "The tour welcomed more than 45,000 visitors and generated a 28% increase in digital service subscriptions in the regions visited. More than 12,000 people benefited from practical training, and the program created a network of 150 local ambassadors who continue to promote digital inclusion in their communities. This deployment model has since been adopted by Orange in other African countries."

The challenge was to position this offering as truly innovative to an urban, digitalized audience that was wary of online banking solutions.",
        "solution": "We developed an omnichannel media strategy combining massive presence and precise targeting. Our approach integrated digital urban displays with contextual content, synchronized dressing of major Moroccan information sites, and ultra-targeted programmatic campaigns based on financial behaviors. The creative message centered on the concept 'Your bank, as mobile as you are' used a visual language inspired by the most popular digital interfaces.",
        "results": "The campaign generated 12.4 million qualified impressions and an engagement rate 340% higher than industry benchmarks. More than 40,000 accounts were opened online in the first two months, exceeding the initial target by 127%. The customer acquisition cost was reduced by 62% compared to traditional channels, establishing a new growth model for the bank."
