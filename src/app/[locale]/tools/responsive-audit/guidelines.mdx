# Responsive Design Guidelines for Genius Ad District

## Core Principles

1. **Mobile-First Approach**
   - Design and develop for mobile devices first, then progressively enhance for larger screens
   - Focus on essential content and features for the mobile experience
   - Ensure all critical functionality works on small screens

2. **Fluid Layouts**
   - Use relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixels where appropriate
   - Implement flexible grid systems that adapt to different screen sizes
   - Set appropriate max-width constraints to prevent overly stretched layouts on large screens

3. **Breakpoint Strategy**
   - Follow Tailwind CSS breakpoint system:
     - `sm`: 640px (Small devices)
     - `md`: 768px (Medium devices)
     - `lg`: 1024px (Large devices)
     - `xl`: 1280px (Extra large devices)
     - `2xl`: 1536px (Extra extra large devices)
   - Avoid adding custom breakpoints unless absolutely necessary
   - Choose breakpoints based on content needs, not specific devices

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use responsive images with appropriate srcsets
   - Lazy load off-screen content
   - Optimize assets for different device capabilities

## Responsive Patterns

### Navigation

- Mobile: Use hamburger menu or simplified navigation
- Tablet: Consider dropdown or expandable sections
- Desktop: Use full horizontal navigation with dropdowns
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44×44px for mobile users

### Typography

- Use responsive type scales:
  - Small screens: Smaller base font size (14-16px)
  - Larger screens: Larger base font size (16-18px)
- Implement fluid typography where appropriate:
  ```css
  font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.5rem + 1vw, 1.5rem);
  ```
- Maintain proper line lengths (45-75 characters per line)

### Images

- Use the Next.js Image component with responsive widths
- Implement art direction when needed using the `<picture>` element
- Ensure images maintain appropriate aspect ratios
- Consider different crops for extreme aspect ratios

### Grid Layouts

- Single column on mobile
- 2-3 columns on tablet
- 3-4+ columns on desktop
- Use gap property for consistent spacing
- Consider asymmetrical grids for visual interest

### Forms

- Stack form fields vertically on mobile
- Use full width inputs on small screens
- Place labels above inputs on mobile, possibly beside them on desktop
- Ensure sufficient spacing between touch targets

## Testing Methodology

1. **Device Testing Checklist**
   - iOS (iPhone SE, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro Max)
   - Android (Pixel 5, Galaxy S21)
   - iPad/Tablets (iPad Mini, iPad Pro)
   - Desktop (1366×768, 1920×1080, 2560×1440)

2. **Browser Testing Matrix**
   - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
   - iOS Safari
   - Samsung Internet

3. **Testing Tools**
   - Use the Responsive Audit Tool
   - Chrome DevTools Device Mode
   - BrowserStack for real device testing

## Common Responsive Issues to Watch For

- **Content Overflow**: Text or elements extending beyond their containers
- **Touch Target Size**: Buttons or links that are too small on mobile
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: Content causing unwanted horizontal scrolling
- **Font Readability**: Text that becomes too small on mobile devices
- **Fixed Positioning**: Elements with fixed positioning breaking layouts
- **Image Scaling**: Images that don't scale appropriately
- **Input Handling**: Form elements that are difficult to interact with

## Responsive-Specific WCAG Requirements

- 1.4.4 Resize Text: Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or function
- 1.4.10 Reflow: Content can be presented without scrolling in two dimensions
- 2.5.5 Target Size: Touch targets should be at least 44×44 pixels

## Implementation Workflow

1. Start with mobile wireframes and designs
2. Develop mobile version first
3. Progressively enhance for larger screens
4. Test across all breakpoints
5. Optimize performance
6. Validate responsive accessibility
